# UnityNetworkStudy
The purpose of this project is to create my first game capable of online multiplayer using Unity's packs and tools available.
Goals: 
1. Connect two players over the internet.
2. have it so players are able to interact with the same objects and each other.
3. Create a mode where players can with each other.
4. Create a mode where players can fight enemies and embark on quest together.

Achievement 1: Through using Unity transport and relay I was able to connect two different builds, both locally and on a friends computer.
